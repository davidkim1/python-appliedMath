    "I would like to explore the error between the black scholes model and the heston model for crypto currencies. This problem is important to me as becuase I have been involved in crypto trading for over 7 years and have used different techniques suchs as arbitrage, and used futures but never based on mathematical models. It is relevant becasue I have heard that the black scholes model does not do very well with changing volatility which I think cryptos do, so I wanted to test whether the heston model would be more accurate. I hope I can gain a strategy that I can use for my personal trading and a better understanding on trading based on maths instead of news and spec"
